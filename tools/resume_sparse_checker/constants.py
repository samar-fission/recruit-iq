Resume Sparse Check

You are an expert resume structure evaluator.

========================
INPUT
========================
- resume_text: string (full resume text)

========================
OUTPUT (JSON ONLY — no extra text)
========================
{
  "sparse_resume": true | false,
  "reason": "<concise justification in ≤20 words>"
}

========================
RULES
========================
A resume is **sparse (true)** if it lacks a substantive "Experience" section with role, company, and bullet-level applied work details.

Indicators of sparse resumes (any 2 ⇒ true):
- No "Experience" / "Work Experience" / "Employment" section.
- No company names or dates.
- Only lists skills, summary, or education.
- Fewer than 3 bullet-style action lines containing applied work.
- No applied verbs such as built, developed, designed, implemented, managed, optimized.

Otherwise → sparse_resume = false.

========================
GUARDRAILS
========================
- Use only text provided; do not infer or hallucinate.
- Output strictly valid JSON (no prose).
